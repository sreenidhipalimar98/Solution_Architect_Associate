API gate way is serverless

VPC


CIDR:
To Speciify the range of addresses we use CIDR blocks

By default newly created subnets are private subnets 
so to get the access to internet for the insatnces present the particular subnets we need to add gate way called internet gateway

here while creating a VPC respective route table will be created but the it will be only having default route only for local
so we need to add the one more route as internet gateway


Cron commands
crontab -e

* * * * * curl API_GATEWAY_URL
* * * * * sleep 15 && curl API_GATEWAY_URL
* * * * * sleep 30 && curl API_GATEWAY_URL
* * * * * sleep 45 && curl API_GATEWAY_URL



Regarding on how to make subnet private 

First remove internet gateway associated with our VPC Route table

create a new subnet for Public access in the same VPC and attach the internate gateway to this route table

Now for private subnet provide route table which is attached with VPC 

for public subnet provide route table which we newly created

WHile using NAT gateway elastic address is mandatory

creat a nat gatwat in public subnet so it has to communicate with the internet


if we want to traffic from particular port to enter our Subnet then we go for NACL(Network Access Control List)
here we can do both deny and allow rules

but in sec grp we can only allow and here rules this is applicable for particular instance
	
S3 is a object storage


Region-specific services: These services can only be used in a specific AWS region. For example, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) can only be used in a specific region.

Availability zone-specific services: These services can only be used in a specific Availability Zone within a region. For example, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets can be created in a specific Availability Zone.

Here is a list of some AWS services that are region specific and Availability zone specific:

Region-specific services:

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Amazon Route 53
Amazon CloudFront
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)


Availability zone-specific services:

Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
Amazon Redshift
Amazon DynamoDB
Amazon ElastiCache
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Multi-AZ deployments
It is important to note that not all AWS services are region specific or Availability zone specific. Some services, such as Amazon CloudWatch, can be used in any region or Availability Zone.

      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}

if we enable object lock in s3 we won't be able to delete any data in the bucket
object automatically turns on versionning


If we want to allow cross domain access to our s3 bucket we need to enable CORS and do some configuaration


In S3 life cycle configuration we can automatically change the storage classes

Which of the following is the customer responsible for updating and patching, according to the AWS shared responsibility model?
Amazon WorkSpaces virtual Windows desktop
==================
Who has the responsibility to patch the host operating system of an Amazon EC2 instance, according to the AWS shared responsibility model?

Customer is responsible for applying patch on guest operating systems


AWS responsibility “Security of the Cloud” - AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.

Customer responsibility “Security in the Cloud” – Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities. For example, a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and, as such, requires the customer to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks. Customers that deploy an Amazon EC2 instance are responsible for management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches), any application software or utilities installed by the customer on the instances, and the configuration of the AWS-provided firewall (called a security group) on each instance. For abstracted services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, AWS operates the infrastructure layer, the operating system, and platforms, and customers access the endpoints to store and retrieve data. Customers are responsible for managing their data (including encryption options), classifying their assets, and using IAM tools to apply the appropriate permissions.

This customer/AWS shared responsibility model also extends to IT controls. Just as the responsibility to operate the IT environment is shared between AWS and its customers, so is the management, operation and verification of IT controls shared. AWS can help relieve customer burden of operating controls by managing those controls associated with the physical infrastructure deployed in the AWS environment that may previously have been managed by the customer. As every customer is deployed differently in AWS, customers can take advantage of shifting management of certain IT controls to AWS which results in a (new) distributed control environment. Customers can then use the AWS control and compliance documentation available to them to perform their control evaluation and verification procedures as required. Below are examples of controls that are managed by AWS, AWS Customers and/or both.

Inherited Controls – Controls which a customer fully inherits from AWS.

Physical and Environmental controls
Shared Controls – Controls which apply to both the infrastructure layer and customer layers, but in completely separate contexts or perspectives. In a shared control, AWS provides the requirements for the infrastructure and the customer must provide their own control implementation within their use of AWS services. Examples include:

Patch Management – AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the infrastructure, but customers are responsible for patching their guest OS and applications.
Configuration Management – AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure devices, but a customer is responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems, databases, and applications.
Awareness & Training - AWS trains AWS employees, but a customer must train their own employees.
Customer Specific – Controls which are solely the responsibility of the customer based on the application they are deploying within AWS services. Examples include:

Service and Communications Protection or Zone Security which may require a customer to route or zone data within specific security environments.

==================
A company is using an Amazon RDS DB instance for an application that is deployed in the AWS Cloud. The company needs regular patching of the operating system of the server where the DB instance runs.

==================
Which AWS Cloud benefit is shown by an architecture's ability to withstand failures with minimal downtime?
High availability 

By building a highly available architecture, organizations can minimize or eliminate the impact of failures on their applications and services. This is achieved through strategies such as redundancy, fault tolerance, and automatic failover. When failures occur, the architecture is designed to quickly and seamlessly recover and continue providing services to users, thereby minimizing or avoiding any downtime.

AWS Trusted Advisior provides infrastructure security optimization recommendation
==================
Under the AWS shared responsibility model, which task is the customer's responsibility when managing AWS Lambda functions?

Creating versions of Lambda functions

AWS Lambda is a service that lets customers run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda automatically scales the resources according to the demand and only charges for the compute time consumed. AWS also provides and manages the Lambda runtime environment, which includes the operating system and the language interpreter2.

Therefore, the customer is responsible for creating versions of Lambda functions, which allows them to publish one or more copies of their function code and configuration as a version. Versions are immutable and have a unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Customers can use versions to manage their code deployment and rollback2. The other tasks are AWS’s responsibility under the shared responsibility model.

AWS X-Ray

AWS X-Ray is a service that helps developers analyze and debug distributed applications. It provides a comprehensive view of how an application's components are performing, including the time it takes for each component to process a request.

AWS X-Ray can be used to trace user requests as they move through a serverless application. To do this, the developer needs to instrument the application's components with the AWS X-Ray SDK. When a user makes a request to the application, the AWS X-Ray SDK will generate a trace ID. This trace ID will be propagated through the application's components, and it will be used to correlate the performance of each component.

Once the request has been processed, the AWS X-Ray SDK will send the trace data to AWS X-Ray. AWS X-Ray will then store the trace data and make it available to the developer for analysis.

knowledge:
AWS CloudTrail is a service that logs all activity in your AWS account. It does not provide tracing capabilities.
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service. It can be used to collect and monitor metrics, logs, and events from your AWS resources. However, it does not provide tracing capabilities.

A company is migrating its on-premises database to Amazon RDS. What should the company do to ensure Amazon RDS costs are kept to a minimum?

Right-size before and after migration.

Right-sizing your Amazon RDS instance is the most important thing you can do to keep costs down. When you right-size your instance, you ensure that you are only paying for the resources that you need.

You should right-size your Amazon RDS instance before and after migration. Before migration, you should estimate the resources that your database will need in the cloud. After migration, you should monitor your database usage and adjust the instance size as needed.

and other things that we need to keep in mind during migration to keep the costs at minimum

Tag and track resource utilization: Properly tag your resources and start tracking their utilization. AWS provides the capability to easily tag any of your RDS instances. To do so, locate your instance on the Amazon RDS console. On the Tags tab, add the tags you need to clearly identify the owner of the RDS instance. For more information about tagging, see Tagging Amazon RDS resources. You can add any tags that can help identify your Amazon RDS resources, such as application name and organization group, but the following two tags are recommended: Database owner and Application owner. This information helps quickly identify the owners and alert them about the opportunity for cost-optimization. You don’t need to do anything to track your resource utilization because Amazon RDS automatically sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch every minute for each active database instance. There are no additional charges for Amazon RDS metrics in CloudWatch. For more information about these metrics, see Overview of monitoring Amazon RDS.

Right-size before and after migration: Right-sizing your Amazon RDS instances can help you save costs. You can use the AWS Trusted Advisor to identify underutilized instances and then resize them to a smaller instance type. For more information, see Resizing your DB instance.

Use Amazon RDS Reserved Instances (RIs): Amazon RDS RIs provide a discounted hourly rate and an optional capacity reservation for EC2 instances. You can choose between three payment options: All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront. Depending on which option you choose, you are discounted differently. For more information on how to optimize your Amazon RDS spend, visit the Amazon RDS Cost and Capacity page.

Use Amazon RDS Performance Insights: Amazon RDS Performance Insights is a performance monitoring tool that helps you analyze and troubleshoot the performance of your Amazon RDS instances. It provides a dashboard that displays the performance of your database instance over time. You can use this tool to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your database instance for better performance.
